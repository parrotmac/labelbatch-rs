# labelbatch-rs

[Incomplete]

Generate a bach of labels using Rust.

Primarily built using
- [genpdf](https://docs.rs/genpdf/latest/genpdf/index.html)
- [font-kit](https://github.com/servo/font-kit)

Originally, this was intended to back a web-based template editor, but it seems the PDF generation won't quite support what I'm after.
